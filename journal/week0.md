# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
I have gone through the videos and i can create my reports.
**Create an Admin Account**
successfully created an Admin user account on AWS using the IAM management console on the AWS poprtal.
![Admin user](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121178341/221856293-340239f6-abdf-4282-97be-41c11a9b8437.PNG)

I was about to grant the user access to view billings and other Administrative privilages by enabling the "IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information"

**Used Cloud shell**
I was able to use the CLI by checking informations and running CLI commands like aws sts get-caller-identity

**Generate AWS Credentials**
generating the AWS Credentials can be found in the week 0 REPOSITORY

**Installed AWS CLI**
INSTALLING THE aws cli was a bit challenging. i succeeded in using the gitpod envronment to achieve that purpose.
lunching gitpod from my Gitlab account.

using the instruction from the video done by Andrew. i was about to activate these commands 
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

NOTE: 
During the process of installation i was unable to create the auto installation whenever Launched Gitpod. the problem here was that i need to 
do a fresh installtion whenever i tired to access AWS cli VIA Gitpod. 
so i decided to do a manual installtion anytime i wanted to use gitpod

What this means is that i do not need to run a fresh installation BUT I can only run " sudo ./aws/install" to install AWS CLI just like the picture below

**Create a Billing Alarm**
Again with the Help of the instruction by Andrew.
 i successfully created a billing alarm using the billing alarm. this was achieved via the billing console on the aws mangement page.
