I was about to grant the user access to view billings and other Administrative privilages by enabling the "IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information"

**Used Cloud shell**
I was able to use the CLI by checking informations and running CLI commands like aws sts get-caller-identity

**Generate AWS Credentials**
generating the AWS Credentials can be found in the week 0 REPOSITORY

**Installed AWS CLI**
INSTALLING THE aws cli was a bit challenging. i succeeded in using the gitpod envronment to achieve that purpose.
lunching gitpod from my Gitlab account.

using the instruction from the video done by Andrew. i was about to activate these commands 
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
NOTE: 
During the process of installation i was unable to create the auto installation whenever Launched Gitpod. the problem here was that i need to 
do a fresh installtion whenever i tired to access AWS cli VIA Gitpod. 
so i decided to do a manual installtion anytime i wanted to use gitpod
